# Staying Safe: Avoiding Bans with These Scripts
When using these scripts, it is crucial to prioritize account safety and take necessary precautions to avoid bans. Please follow the guidelines below to minimize the risks associated with botting:

1. **Choose an Account:**
Only use these scripts on an account that you are willing to use exclusively for botting purposes. Never use these scripts on a main account or an account that you value.

2. **Run Time:**
Be mindful of the run time for your scripts. Running a script continuously for extended periods, such as 8 hours with no breaks, can raise suspicion. It is advisable to introduce breaks or variations in the running schedule to avoid detection.

3. **Dynamic Usage:**
Avoid following a predictable schedule. Vary the frequency and duration of running scripts to make your activities less predictable. This helps to avoid patterns that may appear suspicious.

4. **Coordinate Updates:**
Regularly update the coordinates in the appropriate config files. Over time, game updates and changes may affect the positioning of objects or interfaces. By keeping the coordinates up to date, you ensure accurate interaction with the game world.

5. **Timer Adjustments:**
Customize timers to create larger sleep timers and unique intervals specific to your gameplay. Public scripts often have default timers, so adjusting them adds a layer of individuality to your actions.

6. **Script Variety:**
Mix up the scripts you run. Avoid relying solely on a single script, such as Herblore for money-making purposes. Incorporating different activities and skills diversifies your gameplay, making it less predictable.

7. **Blending In:**
Actively strive to blend in with other players. Avoid bank standing by yourself in deserted areas or low-population worlds, as it may draw attention and raise suspicion. By interacting with the game world and other players, you reduce the likelihood of being reported by others.

8. **Skill Diversity:**
Engage in activities beyond the scripts you are using. Working on other skills or engaging in various gameplay aspects helps create a well-rounded account that resembles a legitimate player, reducing the chances of being flagged as a bot.

9. **Proxies and VPNs:**
The use of proxies and VPNs for botting purposes is a complex topic. While some sources discourage their use, it is advised to conduct thorough research and make informed decisions. Consider the potential risks and benefits associated with proxies and VPNs and evaluate their appropriateness for your specific situation.

It is important to note that no method can guarantee complete safety from bans. Jagex actively monitors and employs detection measures to identify botting activities. Following these guidelines, however, can help minimize the risks and increase the longevity of your botting endeavors.

Please exercise caution, stay informed about the latest developments, and be aware of the potential consequences of using automation scripts in violation of game rules and terms of service.

Remember, the ultimate responsibility lies with you as the user, and it is essential to make informed decisions and accept the associated risks.

Happy botting, and stay safe!
