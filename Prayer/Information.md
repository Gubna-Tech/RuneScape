# Prayer Script Instructions
This AutoHotKey (AHK) script is designed to automate the process of burying bones and/or scattering ashes in RuneScape. Please follow the instructions below to properly set up and use the script:

## General Usage
The script automates the actions of going to a bank, removing bones or ashes, and scattering or burying them. You can customize the script to fit your specific needs.

1. **Bank Coords:**
Start by setting the Bank Coords in the LLARS Config file. These coordinates should match the location of the bank in your game. Refer to the LLARS Config file instructions for detailed guidance on setting coordinates in config files.

2. **Bank Hotkey:**
Change the Bank Hotkey in the config file to match your in-game hotkey for accessing the bank. Also, make sure to set the hotkey for your toolbar, as it will be used to scatter or bury the bones/ashes.

## Timers and Hotkeys: 
By default, the timers and hotkeys are set to generic values. However, it is recommended to customize them to suit your preferences and playstyle.

## Starting the Script: 
Once the config file is properly adjusted to your needs, you can start the script. Press the Start button on the GUI or use the designated start hotkey (default: F9, unless changed in the LLARS Config file).
## Script Execution:
The script will now proceed to the bank, remove the bones or ashes using the assigned hotkey, and scatter or bury them by holding down the hotkey associated with your toolbar item. This process will be repeated for the predetermined number of times.

## Important Considerations
It is recommended to review and modify the timers, hotkeys, and other configurable options in the LLARS Config file to make them more unique and suitable for your specific gameplay.

Please note that this script is provided in its default state and may require adjustments based on your individual preferences and game setup.

Keep in mind that using automation scripts like this can be against the terms of service or rules of the game. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with the game's policies.
