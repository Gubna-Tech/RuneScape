# Cooking Script Instructions
This AutoHotKey (AHK) script is designed to automate the cooking process in RuneScape. Please follow the instructions below to properly set up and use the script:

## Config File
Before using the script, please ensure the following configurations in the LLARS Config file:

1. **Configure Bank Prime Coordinates:** While standing in front of the bank stall, select the Bank Prime Coordinates. These coordinates should represent the location of the bank stall. Make note of these coordinates for configuration in the Config file.

2. **Configure Range Coordinates:** Walk over to the range where you will be cooking and take note of the Range Coordinates. These coordinates should correspond to the location of the range.

3. **Configure Bank Main Coordinates:** Move back to the bank as though you were cooking and obtain the Bank Main Coordinates. These coordinates should reflect the location of the bank.

4. **Config File Setup:** Open the Config file located in the same directory as the script. Enter the gathered coordinates into the appropriate fields in the Config file.
Timers and Hotkeys:
By default, the timers and hotkeys are set to generic values. However, it is recommended to customize them to suit your preferences and playstyle.

## Starting the Script:
Once the config file is properly adjusted to your needs, you can start the script. Press the Start button on the GUI or use the designated start hotkey (default: F9, unless changed in the LLARS Config file).

## Script Execution:
The script will now proceed to the bank, remove the bones or ashes using the assigned hotkey, and scatter or bury them by holding down the hotkey associated with your toolbar item. This process will be repeated for the predetermined number of times.

## Important Considerations
It is recommended to review and modify the timers, hotkeys, and other configurable options in the LLARS Config file to make them more unique and suitable for your specific gameplay.

Please note that this script is provided in its default state and may require adjustments based on your individual preferences and game setup.

Keep in mind that using automation scripts like this can be against the terms of service or rules of the game. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with the game's policies.
