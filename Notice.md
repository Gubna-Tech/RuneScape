# LLARS Project: Note to the Public

First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has shown interest in and provided valuable suggestions for the LLARS project. Your support has been instrumental in shaping its development, and I am truly thankful for your contributions.

I would like to take this opportunity to clarify my stance on donations. While I appreciate the generosity of those who have expressed a desire to support the project financially, I want to make it clear that I am not currently accepting donations, whether in-game or otherwise. Please note that any noted supporters are individuals who showed their support prior to the project's public launch. I appreciate your understanding in this matter.

As the LLARS project is still in its Alpha phase, I want to address some important aspects related to its future. Due to the nature of this stage, scripts and updates may be released without prior notice. This means that there will not always be warnings or announcements about what is currently being worked on or tested. Please bear with us during this phase, as we strive to improve the scripts's functionality and stability.

Looking ahead, I would like to inform you that the next round of scripts will be released in approximately 2-3 weeks from the date of this post, which is 5/21/2023. These upcoming scripts will be specifically tailored for and inspired by the next Double XP event in the game. We are excited to bring you an optimized and enhanced experience during this event, and we hope it will exceed your expectations.

I would also like to acknowledge those who have expressed their interest in becoming beta testers. I have personally reached out to all potential testers and have provided them with the necessary information. At this time, I do not require additional beta testers. However, I appreciate your enthusiasm and support, and I may consider expanding the testing team in the future.

Once again, thank you all for your interest, suggestions, and ongoing support of the LLARS project. Your involvement plays a crucial role in shaping its development, and I look forward to bringing you more exciting updates as we progress.
