# AutoAlch Script Instructions
This AutoHotKey (AHK) script is designed to automate the low/high alchemy process in RuneScape, allowing for easy XP gains. Please follow the instructions below to properly set up and use the script:

## General Usage
The script automatically alchs the desired number of items a specified time, saving you time and effort. The setup and usage of this script are straightforward.

## Configurations
Before using the script, ensure that the following configuration is correctly set:

1. **Skillbar Hotkey:** Match the Skillbar Hotkey in the config file to the in-game hotkey for the low/high alchemy icon location. This ensures that the script interacts with the correct hotkey to activate the alchemy process.
Starting the Script
Once the Skillbar Hotkey is correctly configured in the config file, you can start the script by executing it.

2. **Item:**
Select the coordinates of the item in your inventory you wish to alch. Place the selected coordinates in the config file within the same directory.

## Script Execution
The script will automatically perform the alchemy action based on the desired number of times to run. It will activate the specified hotkey on the skillbar to trigger the alchemy skill followed by a click of the item to be alched, allowing for efficient XP gains.

## Important Considerations
It is recommended to review and modify the timers, hotkeys, and other configurable options in the LLARS Config file to make them more unique and suitable for your specific gameplay.

Please note that this script is provided in its default state and may require adjustments based on your individual preferences and game setup.

Keep in mind that using automation scripts like this can be against the terms of service or rules of the game. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with the game's policies.
