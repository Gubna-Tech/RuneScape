# Important Note for Script Use
### *Please be aware that you do not need to make changes to the script itself, only to the LLARS Config and Config files that have been provided.*
Please note that the scripts in this repository are specifically designed for **RuneScape3 (RS3)** and are not intended for use with Old School RuneScape (OSRS). Make sure to use these scripts only with the appropriate version of the game to ensure compatibility and compliance with the game's terms of service.

## Requirements:
To run the scripts in this project, you will need to have AutoHotkey (AHK) installed on your system. Please note that all scripts are provided in an uncompiled format, which means you will need AHK installed to execute them.

## Notepad++ for Configuration Files:
While you can use any text editor to work with the configuration files, it is worth noting that using Notepad++ can greatly enhance your editing experience.

Notepad++ is a popular text editor that provides several useful features, including syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting helps in visually distinguishing different elements in the configuration files, making them easier to read and understand.

By using Notepad++, you can take advantage of its enhanced functionality and improved readability when working with the configuration files.

If you are unfamiliar with .ini files or find them challenging to read and edit, using Notepad++ can be particularly beneficial. Notepad++ simplifies the process by highlighting important sections, keywords, and values, making it easier to navigate and modify the configuration files.
