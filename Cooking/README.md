# Cooking Script Instructions
### *Please be aware that you do not need to make changes to the script itself, only to the LLARS Config and Config files that have been provided.*
This AutoHotKey (AHK) script is designed to automate the cooking process in RuneScape. Please follow the instructions below to properly set up and use the script:

## Bank Stall Setup: 
Start in front of a bank stall in Catherby bank.

1. **Configure Bank Prime Coordinates:** While standing in front of the bank stall, select the Bank Prime Coordinates. These coordinates should represent the location of the bank stall. Make note of these coordinates for configuration in the Config file.

2. **Configure Range Coordinates:** Take note of the Range Coordinates from the bank stall. These coordinates should correspond to the location of the range.

3. **Configure Bank Main Coordinates:** Walk over to the range where you will be cooking as though you were cooking and obtain the Bank Main Coordinates. These coordinates should reflect the location of the bank.

4. **Config File Setup:** Open the Config file located in the same directory as the script. Enter the gathered coordinates into the appropriate fields in the Config file.

5. **Walk Timer Adjustment:** The script includes a walk timer that determines the time it takes to move across a game tile (1 game tick). It is highly recommended to customize this timer to match your specific gameplay. Adjust the timer to the desired time in milliseconds (ms).

## Starting the Script: 
Once the coordinates and walk timer have been adjusted in the Config file, you can start the script by executing it.

## Script Execution:
The script will automatically perform the cooking actions based on the configured coordinates and walk timer. It will interact with the bank, walk to the cooking range, cook the desired item, and repeat the process as specified.

## Important Considerations
It is recommended to review and modify the timers, hotkeys, and other configurable options in the LLARS Config file to make them more unique and suitable for your specific gameplay.

Please note that this script is provided in its default state and may require adjustments based on your individual preferences and game setup.

Keep in mind that using automation scripts like this can be against the terms of service or rules of the game. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with the game's policies.
