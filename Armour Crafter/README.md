# Armour Crafting Script Instructions

This AutoHotKey (AHK) script is designed to automate the armour crafting process in RuneScape. Please follow the instructions below to properly set up and use the script:

## Config File
Before using the script, please ensure the following configurations in the LLARS Config file:

1. **Item Configuration:**
   In the [Item Config] section of the config file, find the item you want to craft by using Ctrl+F to search. Make sure the item name matches the in-game item you want to craft.

2. **Material Placement:**
   Place the material type required for crafting in your toolbar. Match the hotkey for the material type with the corresponding field in the config file.

3. **Bank Preset Configuration:**
   Set up your bank preset to match the hotkey specified in the config file. This ensures the script can access the required materials efficiently.

4. **In-Game Crafting Coordinates:**
   Locate the item you wish to craft in the config file using Ctrl+F to search. Ensure that the in-game crafting coordinates in the respective section match the item's position on the crafting interface.

## Timers and Hotkeys:
By default, the timers and hotkeys are set to generic values. However, it is recommended to customize them according to your preferences and playstyle.

## Starting the Script:
Once the config file is properly adjusted to your needs, you can start the script. Press the Start button on the GUI or use the designated start hotkey (default: F9, unless changed in the LLARS Config file).

## Script Execution:
The script will now proceed to the crafting interface and initiate the crafting process based on the provided configuration. This process will be repeated for the predetermined number of times.

## Important Considerations:
It is recommended to review and modify the timers, hotkeys, and other configurable options in the LLARS Config file to make them more unique and suitable for your specific gameplay.

Please note that this script is provided in its default state and may require adjustments based on your individual preferences and game setup.

Keep in mind that using automation scripts like this may violate the terms of service or rules of the game. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with the game's policies.
