# AFK Combat Script Instructions

This AutoHotKey (AHK) script is designed to automate combat actions in RuneScape for an AFK experience. Please follow the instructions below to properly set up and use the script:

## Aggression Potions or Flasks
To use the AFK Combat script, you will need to have Aggression Potions or Flasks. Please configure the following settings in the config file:

1. Set the toolbar hotkey for the Aggression Flask or Potion in the config file to match the in-game hotkey.
2. Ensure that the option for Aggression Potions or Flasks is set to true in the config file.

## Anti-AFK Configuration
To avoid being logged out due to inactivity, the script includes an Anti-AFK feature. Configure the following settings in the config file:

1. Set the option for Anti-AFK to true in the config file.
2. Enter the coordinates to click on a "dead" space in the game, such as blank inventory spaces or the tops of windows like the minimap.

## Potion Configuration
The script supports various optional potions. Configure the following settings in the config file for each desired potion:

1. If you want to use a specific potion, set the option for that potion to true in the config file.
2. Set the minimum and maximum timers for random intervals between drinking potion doses.
3. Ensure that the toolbar hotkey for the potion matches the in-game hotkey and is set in the config file.

Please note that if the option for a specific potion is set to false, you do not need to configure the associated settings.

## Starting the Script
Once the config file is properly adjusted to your needs, you can start the script. Press the Start button on the GUI or use the designated start hotkey (default: F9, unless changed in the LLARS Config file).

## Important Considerations
It is recommended to review and modify the timers, hotkeys, and other configurable options in the LLARS Config file to make them more unique and suitable for your specific gameplay.

Please note that this script is provided in its default state and may require adjustments based on your individual preferences and game setup.

Keep in mind that using automation scripts like this can be against the terms of service or rules of the game. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with the game's policies.
