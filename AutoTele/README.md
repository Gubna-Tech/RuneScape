# AutoTele Script Instructions
### *Please be aware that you do not need to make changes to the script itself, only to the LLARS Config and Config files that have been provided.*
This AutoHotKey (AHK) script is designed to automate the teleportation process in RuneScape, allowing for easy XP gains. Please follow the instructions below to properly set up and use the script:

## General Usage
The script automatically teleports you the desired number of times to a selected location, saving you time and effort. The setup and usage of this script are straightforward.

## Configurations
Before using the script, ensure that the following configuration is correctly set:

1. **Skillbar Hotkey:** Match the Skillbar Hotkey in the config file to the in-game hotkey for the teleport icon location. This ensures that the script interacts with the correct hotkey to activate the teleportation process.
Starting the Script
Once the Skillbar Hotkey is correctly configured in the config file, you can start the script by executing it.

## Timers and Hotkeys:
By default, the timers and hotkeys are set to generic values. However, it is recommended to customize them to suit your preferences and playstyle.

## Starting the Script:
Once the config file is properly adjusted to your needs, you can start the script. Press the Start button on the GUI or use the designated start hotkey (default: F9, unless changed in the LLARS Config file).

## Script Execution:
The script will now proceed to the bank, remove the bones or ashes using the assigned hotkey, and scatter or bury them by holding down the hotkey associated with your toolbar item. This process will be repeated for the predetermined number of times.

## Important Considerations
It is recommended to review and modify the timers, hotkeys, and other configurable options in the LLARS Config file to make them more unique and suitable for your specific gameplay.

Please note that this script is provided in its default state and may require adjustments based on your individual preferences and game setup.

Keep in mind that using automation scripts like this can be against the terms of service or rules of the game. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with the game's policies.
