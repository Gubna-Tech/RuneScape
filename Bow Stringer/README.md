# Bow Stringing Script Instructions
### *Please be aware that you do not need to make changes to the script itself, only to the LLARS Config and Config files that have been provided.*
This AutoHotKey (AHK) script is designed to automate the process of stringing bows in RuneScape. Please follow the instructions below to properly set up and use the script:

## General Usage
The script automates the actions of going to a bank, pressing a hotkey to access the inventory, and stringing a full inventory of bows. The script can be customized to suit your specific needs.

## Config File
Before using the script, please ensure the following configurations in the LLARS Config file:

1. **Bank Coords:** Set the Bank Coords in the LLARS Config file to match the location of the bank in your game. Refer to the LLARS Config file instructions for detailed guidance on setting coordinates in config files.

2. **Bank Hotkey:** Change the Bank Hotkey in the config file to match your in-game hotkey for accessing the bank. Additionally, set the hotkey for your inventory or item switch as it will be used to interact with the unstrung bows.

## Timers and Hotkeys
By default, the timers and hotkeys are set to generic values. It is highly recommended to customize these settings according to your preferences and playstyle.

## Starting the Script
Once the config file is properly adjusted to your needs, you can start the script. Press the Start button on the GUI or use the designated start hotkey (default: F9, unless changed in the LLARS Config file).

## Script Execution
The script will proceed to the bank, press the designated hotkey to access the inventory, and automatically string a full inventory of bows. This process will be repeated for the predetermined number of times.

## Important Considerations
It is recommended to review and modify the timers, hotkeys, and other configurable options in the LLARS Config file to make them more unique and suitable for your specific gameplay.

Please note that this script is provided in its default state and may require adjustments based on your individual preferences and game setup.

Keep in mind that using automation scripts like this can be against the terms of service or rules of the game. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with the game's policies.
